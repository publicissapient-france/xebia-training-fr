<h2>Portfolio Story Mapping<br>A Strategic Perspective by Mack Adams</br></h2>

<p>As User Story Mapping, a technique for collaboratively planning product backlogs, continues to be adopted by more and more organizations, it is also evolving to fit their particular context. New patterns are emerging as the size and scope of its application increases - team, project, program and portfolio. While the basic construct remains the same at each level, the coarseness of the detail or scale of the work being discussed decreases or increases - it's like the planning tool's version of an accordion, though, slightly less complex to learn.</p>
<p>One particular pattern being used more regularly is that of Product Portfolio Story Mapping.  Broadly, this means mapping out multiple products simultaneously, and depending on the goals of the planning exercise, either build on new features or adjust backlogs that are already planned out.</p>
<p>However, if you thought you needed a lot of space for a single product's story map, for portfolio level, a lot of wall space is required!</p>

<p>The fundamentals here are the same as any story mapping exercise in that the aim is to map out the Users, Activities, Tasks and so on in a temporal fashion that mimics the actual usage of the product to be constructed.  However, when this starts to happen across multiple products in parallel, more preparation is required to ensure that we can do some "apples to apples" assessments later on - notably around the consistent use of Personas on which to hang all the functionality.  In some cases the products may address similar needs (likely if they are considered to be in a 'portfolio'), in which case, Persona reuse is feasible.  Of similar importance is having all the product maps roughly at the same level of granularity, so that one product's Post-It doesn't equate to 25 of anotherâ€™s.  In any case, once some time has been invested in building out the maps, we can start to look across them, which in and of itself, may be a powerful perspective for each of the respective teams and whomever is governing across all of them to have.</p>
<p>Some additional layers worth trying out, and even more so, simultaneously, could include having some people from Product Marketing looking across the different products to see what themes they can draw out that might create a more compelling go-to-market story.  Particularly if products are, or will be, used in conjunction with one another, this gives them a holistic view that's hard to come by in a single backlog.  Concurrently, the Enterprise Architects can also gaze across and assess where strategic re-use may be possible, if investments in new technology are worth the cost, or if features adhere to broader architectural goals or themes.  Beyond that, collectively there's some dependency planning, reduction of redundant work and general alignment of deliveries that quickly emerge for the meta-maps.</p> 
<p>At its heart, User Story Mapping is a dynamic, team-focused, collaborative planning technique that can be applied in a variety of situations.  By scaling up to the Portfolio level we can extend the benefits of Story Mapping to a more strategic perspective.</p>
