        <h2>A propos de Jeff Sutherland (Co-fondateur de scrum)</h2>
        <p>Jeff Sutherland started the first Scrum at Easel Corporation in 1993. He worked with Ken Schwaber to emerge Scrum as a formal process at OOPSLA ’95. Together, they extended and enhanced Scrum at many software companies and IT organizations and helped write the Agile Manifesto.</p> 

    <p>Jeff is the CEO of Scrum Inc., Chairman of the Scrum Foundation and Agile coach to OpenView Venture Partners which runs all its internal operations with Scrum, as well as 18 portfolio software companies. As Senior Advisor to OpenView he focuses on using Scrum to transform companies as well as empower software developers. Jeff has been VP of Engineering, CTO, or CEO of 11 companies and implemented Scrum in 7 of them including his current company which runs Scrum for sales, marketing, training, consulting, finance, and content production. 18 years of hands on team building experience gives Jeff's training and consulting unique added value. His experience in teaching Scrum at the Harvard Business School helps with management workshops.</p>

<p>In Jeff's courses, participants learn how to stop thrashing and improve performance along with everything necessary for getting started with Scrum. There are very few rules to Scrum so it is important to learn its fundamental principles by experiencing them directly from those who have implemented the best Scrums in the software industry. Participants gain hands-on practice with the release backlog, sprint backlog, the daily Scrum meeting, tracking progress with a burndown chart, and more. Participants experience the Scrum process through a “59-minute Scrum” and the "XP Game” which simulate Scrum projects through non-technical group exercises.</p>

<p>Dr. Sutherland's training is helpful to every employee in a Scrum company. Most of his Openview portfolio companies use Scrum in sales, marketing, finance, or in the senior management team, so you will often see these people in his classes. Every developer can benefit by getting a thorough grounding in Scrum basics. Some of Jeff's companies send every employee, including adminstrative assistants to his courses. These companies always experience radical growth and profitablility when everyone in on the same page with the Scrum process. In addition, many Certified ScrumMasters use his courses as a refresher as they often contain advanced material depending on who is in the class. CSMs and CSPs may attend his training at reduced rates</p>
