        <h1>Joseph Little (Certified Scrum Trainer)</h1>
            <p>
                Joe is an Agile coach and Certified Scrum Trainer (CST). His goal is to use Lean-Agile principles and practices to help firms deliver more business value for customers, to make workers’ lives better and to benefit stakeholders. Helping teams discover business value is one of his passions. And helping teams discover new avenues to greater productivity.</p>
            <p>    
                He is proud for several people he has mentored, who now themselves are very strong in Agile. Joe learned Scrum from Ken Schwaber and later mentored with Jeff Sutherland, with whom he continues to co-teach. He also works with several other CSTs (and friends).</p>
            <p>  
                He has produced Lean Software training with the Poppendiecks. His preference is to practice Agile as a combination of Scrum, XP and Lean principles and practices. Joe has been a speaker at many conferences, including Agile20xx and Agile Tour (several locations and years).</p>
             <p>     
                He started the Agile-Carolinas user group. He has been working in software development and new product development for 20+ years. So he is probably a real geek now. He started his own firm in 1991. Many years ago, he was a Big 6 management consultant.</p>
            <p> 
                He has been a senior business and IT consultant to a number of household names in New York, London and Charlotte. He now has worked on lean-agile-scrum in the US, Canada, France, Peru, Argentina, India and Romania. So far.</p>
            <p>
                Born in Virginia, he lived in NYC for 20+ years. Joe now lives with his family in Charlotte, NC. He has a BA in English from Yale and an MBA from NYU. Joe also has the CSM, CSP and CST certifications from Scrum Alliance.</p>
