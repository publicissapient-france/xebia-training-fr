            <p class="bio">Dan writes software and coaches teams in agile and lean methods. He believes in putting people first and writing simple, pragmatic software. He believes that most problems that teams face are about communication, and all the others are too.</p>
            <p class="bio">This is why he puts so much emphasis on "getting the words right", and why he is so passionate about behaviour-driven development, communication and how people learn. He has been working in the IT industry since he graduated in 1991, and he occasionally blogs at <a href="http://www.dannorth.net/">dannorth.net</a>.</p>

        <h1 class="course_title">FORMATION FASTER ORGANISATIONS : BUSINESS AGILITY FOR IT LEADERS</h1>
                <p>Whether you realise it or not, your organisation is set up to resist effective delivery. Hierarchical reporting lines, annual budget cycles, and time-consuming hand-offs are just the start. Your agile rollout may have reduced project timescales from years to months, but why stop there?</p>
                <p>
                  Some teams deliver in days rather than months to delighted users and iterate in hours rather than weeks. These teams don’t just break all the rules, they make up new ones of their own. And they only exist in organisations that can support them.
                </p>
                <p>On this course you will learn more effective techniques for achieving business agility and organisational effectiveness and understand the principles behind them. Using a mixture of discussion, instruction and exploration you will start to think differently about organisational structure and team makeup, budgeting, risk-based planning, estimation, organisational change and more. You will learn how you and your organisation can respond to changing business needs faster than they thought possible.
