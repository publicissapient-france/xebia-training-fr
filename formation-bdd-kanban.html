        <h3>Differentiation, Complexity & Cynefin (Discussion, Workshop)</h3>
        <p>Every project involves doing something new; something that we’ve never done before.</p>
        <p>In this session we see if we can identify the differentiators for our companies and projects. These are the places where requirements will be harder to understand and implement, and where practices which allow us to respond to discoveries are essential.</p>
        <p>Cynefin is a framework for helping us work out if we are dealing with complexity or if work is merely complicated, and to consider different approaches for each.</p>
        <h3>The Deliberate Discovery Workshop</h3>
        <p>Using real problems encountered on different projects, we look at two ways of improving processes. Deliberate Discovery helps us discover information early, before making commitments, while Real Options helps us to be resilient in the face of the unexpected. This workshop is a great way to think about root causes, as well as providing a clear, easy retrospective format for any difficulty.</p>
        <h3>The Pennies Game</h3>
        <p>Now that we have a better understanding of complexity in software, we know that a lot of our work involves learning and discovery. The Pennies Game will show us the difference between working as individuals, and working as a team, when getting feedback quickly and sharing knowledge are the most important things you can be doing.</p>
        <h3>Kanban 101 (Talk)</h3>
        <p>Kanban practices are similar to those of Agile, but it has a slightly different focus. Using principles from Lean Product Development (as opposed to Lean Manufacturing), it handles both new and familiar work gracefully, while allowing expedited bugs to interrupt the workflow.</p>
<p>This session provides a simple overview of Kanban, its values and its practices.</p>
<h3>The Kanban Game</h3>
        <p>In this game, we look at the effects of limiting Work in Progress, and the signals that help people know what work to do next, when to stop and help someone else, and when to simply take a step back and reflect on the system as a whole.</p>
        <h3>BDD and Feature Injection (Mixed talk and workshop)</h3>
        <p>Behaviour-Driven Development helps technical and business-focused team members to have useful conversations about the requirements, then carry the language of those conversations into the code, often turning the scenarios discussed into tests.This session is completely non-technical and focuses on effective conversations – the real benefit of BDD. This helps teams quickly focus on differentiators, express familiar work in familiar terms, and feed back understanding so that missed scope is spotted early</p>
        <h3>Review</h3>
        <p>A look back at everything learned so far.</p>
        <h3>Closer Capabilities (Workshop)</h3>
        <p>What are the capabilities of a Monopoly game? How about a trading platform? Amazon’s book store? A washing machine? Twitter?</p>
        <p>Now that we’ve identified the capabilities, can we phrase scenarios around them? What are the different behaviours involved in each capability, and what are the edge-cases needed to cope with exceptions?</p>
        <p>Which scenarios would make good candidates for automation, and what would you do to test the others?</p>
        <h3>Visualise your Workflow</h3>
        <p>In this session, we look at different ways to visualise the workflow - including working out what the workflow is in the first place!</p>
        <h3>Retrospectives and Futurespectives</h3>
        <p>One of Kanban’s core practices is: “improve collaboratively, evolve experimentally”.</p>
        <p>In this session we look at some simple ways of doing that, and try out a futurespective around what a Kanban adoption might look like.</p>
