                <p>“Specification by Example: From User Stories to Acceptance Tests” is an interactive workshop, aimed at providing skills to bridge the communication gap between stakeholders and implementation teams, build quality into software from the start, design, develop and deliver systems fit for purpose by applying emerging collaborative requirements management, specification and testing practices in agile and lean processes.</p>
                <p>The workshop is based on Gojko Adzic's books ‘Bridging the Communication Gap’ and ‘Specification by Example’, as well as years of practical experience with many teams in different contexts. The workshop is very interactive and practical, focused on providing participants with first-hand real world experience and aimed at cross-functional training groups of business analysts, product owners, developers and testers.
